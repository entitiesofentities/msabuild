### 1. Mid-Career Modernism: Opportunities and Challenges

Organizer: Kevin Dettmar (Pomona College)

Invited Participants: TBA

Early academic career paths are fairly well mapped as we pursue tenure or the first book. We talk less explicitly about subsequent career stages. This workshop convenes engaged mid-career academics to discuss opportunities they've pursued (or consciously avoided) during this professional stage. Topics include publication, pedagogy, service, administration, and work-life balance.
 
### 2. Preparing an Effective Grant Application

Organizer: Kevin Dettmar (Pomona College)

Invited Participants: TBA

Resources to support humanities scholarship are limited, and granting agencies’ criteria sometimes opaque. Representatives from two large humanities funding agencies will talk about how to identify likely sources of support and how to write a compelling grant application.

### 3. What Do Presses Want From Your (Modernist) Book?

Organizer: Matthew Hart (Columbia University)

This workshop will bring together commissioning editors from leading university presses and series editors to address a range of practical, intellectual and professional issues involved in conceiving, writing, and proposing a monograph in modernist studies and related fields.

### 4. Overcoming Writing Obstacles

Organizers: Elisabeth Joyce (Edinboro University), Katherine Fusco (University of Nevada)

This workshop will assist the early-career writer and academic in developing tools and strategies to be productive in spite of daunting impediments, such as negative criticism or heavy teaching loads.
